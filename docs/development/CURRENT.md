`main` and `dev` runtime baselines remain unchanged by documentation-only commits. Work-branch checkpoints are development evidence until their required validation and maintainer acceptance are complete.

## Current phase

The project remains in **Phase 2A — 0.0.2 Home carrier / presentation architecture**.

The selected Home direction is an existing-host composition rather than the superseded permanent extra-participant / occupancy-handoff route:

`MiuiNotificationStatusContainer / system_icon_area -> host-scoped overlay -> resolved Home layout -> Combined Status renderer`

SystemUI remains authoritative for surrounding native layout, Battery scene/hide behavior, native tint semantics, and charging/Super-Island motion. Combined Status owns its compact composition plus only narrowly scoped, reversible Home presentation state.

Home -> shade / Control Center projection is **Phase 2B**. Keyguard / lockscreen / AOD follows after Phase 2B.

## Current runtime checkpoints

- Builds 386-393 are historical evidence for the superseded permanent extra-participant route; they are not the current architecture premise.
- **Build 397** is the first device-accepted checkpoint for the tested Phase-2A charging-carrier scenarios.
- **Build 398** strengthens stable width authority by using the live native `battery_icon_container`; it is carried forward but was not separately device-promoted before the next checkpoints.
- **Build 399** separates active/inactive battery-ring arc compositing without reopening Home carrier ownership.
- **Build 403 / `20260927-403`** established the current HyperOS battery semantic-color implementation. Runtime source: `97ef67e648906a4b9bb2ce4d7dd390e955831189`.
- **Build 404 / `20260927-404`** is a completed but **device-rejected optical-parity A/B checkpoint**. Runtime source: `614c6ae96f1753088e21ce3568d969b900852081`. It removed percentile alpha remapping while retaining the existing bitmap-probe rendering path; target-device feedback shows the center presentation is visually worse than Build 403, so authored-alpha preservation alone is not an accepted fix.
- **Build 405 / `20260927-405`** is a completed but **device-rejected direct-final-Drawable optical-parity A/B checkpoint**. Runtime source: `bf8091c8680dec7b85c58afded7f476ec95ca49d`. It removed the intermediate final-presentation bitmap/resample stage, but target-device screenshots still show the native center glyph materially lighter/lower-opacity than neighboring native status icons across light and dark surfaces. The direct-Drawable mechanism remains preferable to the superseded bitmap presentation path, but it is not sufficient for parity by itself.
- **Build 406 / `20260927-406`** is a completed but **device-rejected tint-variant A/B checkpoint**. Runtime source: `3d5e9d2339824c6d19e50dda170917559369135b`. Work Branch Canary #335 passed all CI/signing gates, but target-device evidence shows the center Wi-Fi glyph remains optically lighter/lower-coverage than the outer ring **even when `centerFollowsBatteryColor=false`**. Therefore the Build-406 hypothesis that the remaining defect was confined to the custom/battery-color tint branch is rejected.
- Build 406 trusted validation: owner `/canary` Work Branch Canary #335 **succeeded**. Validated PR head `80f371784ffaee406dd6ea5728219eeee5913318` differs from the frozen runtime source only in `CURRENT.md` and `DEVLOG.md`, so executable content remains exactly Build 406. Artifact `10929711688`; artifact ZIP digest `sha256:c7af997217acd171c66beb860d7212c0d72fd672a38978f7b5c2eb5a524f11ba`; extracted APK SHA-256 `e086d8914fece7ba8ea86200756f4a6366d56dadaa5510846618a4077e6ddd80`.
- Documentation-only commits may advance PR #105 beyond the Build-405 runtime source without creating a new runtime Build; runtime identity remains the Build/source pair above until executable source changes.

Build 403 validation already established:
- Fast Build #1063: **success**;
- signed Work Branch Canary #322: **success**;
- target-profile, unit/build, Modern Xposed metadata, signing, non-debuggable and artifact checks: **passed**.

Build 404 validation:
- source review: **passed**;
- Fast Build #1088 on validation PR #130: **success** at tested head `ad55baa47eecadfa7fe1968556d5c7f13a1be460`;
- signed Work Branch Canary #324: **success**; the Canary job explicitly checked out the same tested head and passed target-profile, unit/build, Modern Xposed metadata, Haple signature, non-debuggable, and artifact checks;
- compare evidence from runtime source `614c6ae96f1753088e21ce3568d969b900852081` to tested head `ad55baa47eecadfa7fe1968556d5c7f13a1be460` shows only `CURRENT.md` / `DEVLOG.md` documentation changes, so the validated executable runtime remains Build 404;
- signed artifact: `CombinedStatus-0.0.2-HyperOS-20260927-404-canary.apk`;
- artifact ZIP digest: `sha256:694c81c37b5dc8227f0da076211ae538ac9250770da2eb97003be0727734c79f`;
- extracted APK SHA-256: `eb16169738f3e16bcd208463ae4fc638898c3c46f2ca3b43efea3bda625519f1`;
- device optical-parity acceptance: **rejected / regressed versus Build 403**; battery semantic-color acceptance remains a separate open device gate.
- validation-only PRs #129 and #130 are closed after evidence capture; neither is mergeable product work.

## Active runtime issues / validation

### Visual intensity / optical parity — open

Build 406 target-device feedback is **negative** and corrects the previous narrow diagnosis. The center native Wi-Fi glyph remains visibly lighter / lower-coverage than the outer ring and neighboring native status icons even with **center follows battery color disabled**. Therefore the remaining mismatch is not confined to the custom semantic-color branch and cannot be closed by selecting the native `_tint` sibling only when custom coloring is enabled.

Pixel inspection of the supplied screenshot supports two separate observations:
- on the light embedded Settings surface, the darkest center and ring pixels are similar, but the center's overall gray distribution is lighter, consistent with lower optical coverage / antialias weight rather than only a different flat tint value;
- on the live dark status bar, the center's brightest core is materially dimmer than the outer ring, so source/presentation alpha remains state-dependent as well.

Build-403 history is therefore relevant again as evidence, not as an implementation to restore blindly. Build 403 used an 85th-percentile source-alpha ceiling and normalized the rasterized native-center mask before final tint. Build 404 removed that normalization and visibly regressed. Builds 405/406 removed the final bitmap-resample path / added one tint-resource branch, but did not recover parity. The current interpretation is that Build 403's normalization was compensating a real **final native presentation / optical-coverage mismatch** that still exists in the direct-Drawable path.

Current boundary:
- do **not** reinstate Build-403 percentile normalization as the final solution without locating the native responsibility it was compensating;
- do **not** add opacity multipliers, per-glyph gray constants, screenshot-fitted thresholds or source-asset edits;
- do **not** treat `centerFollowsBatteryColor` as the root boundary; both enabled and disabled states are affected;
- source review of the current Painter closes a simpler responsibility boundary first: **every native center Drawable is externally tinted through `Drawable.setTint(...)`, including the default `centerFollowsBatteryColor=false` path**. Therefore the module is semantically in HyperOS's `useTint=true` branch whenever it draws these native center resources, and must use the verified `_tint` mask variant before applying that tint;
- a live native-ImageView presentation mirror is deferred because it is unnecessary for this narrower A/B and would add a larger ownership/data-flow surface than the already-verified resource contract;
- preserve Build-405 direct final-bounds Drawable rendering as the cleaner rendering baseline while investigating the presentation source;
- center geometry, battery semantic colors, Home carrier/spacing and Phase-2B behavior remain out of scope for this root-cause pass.

### Battery semantic colors — implemented, device acceptance still open

Build 403 uses HyperOS `MiuiBatteryMeterIconView.getProgressStatus()` as semantic-state authority. Charging, power-save, performance, and low-battery colors come from SystemUI's already-loaded native color fields when HyperOS optimization allows them; normal state and unavailable semantic colors fall back to the resolved native status-icon tint.

No user-facing per-state color picker/source selector is exposed yet. The future policy seam remains: **System default / Follow status icon / Custom** for NORMAL / CHARGING / POWER_SAVE / PERFORMANCE / LOW.

### Home -> shade scene boundary — next separate issue

A shallow notification-shade pull / final held-return frame can still leave the Home Combined Status overlay visible. This is **not intended final behavior** and is classified as the next Phase-2B scene-boundary/handoff problem, not as a reason to reopen the accepted steady Home carrier.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Home is the only Combined Status rendering surface currently treated as runtime-verified.
- Unsupported/unverified surfaces remain native until their own host/lifecycle/handoff contract is validated.
- Reuse authoritative HyperOS/SystemUI state and resources when a verified source exists.
- Native peer geometry, Battery translation/alpha/visibility, and island animation remain SystemUI-owned.
- No polling, per-frame follower, timing retry, duplicate layout-occupancy owner, or magic translation/margin compensation should be introduced for scene handoff.
- Fail toward native SystemUI when an ownership, compatibility, or restoration contract cannot be established safely.

## Repository / branch synchronization

- PR #100 remains the architecture work branch based on `dev`.
- PR #105 is intentionally stacked on PR #100.
- PR #134 installed the trusted work-branch Canary fallback into `main`; PR #136 history-preserving back-synced that accepted process state into `dev`.
- PR #135 then fixed Markdown backtick escaping in the Canary source summary without changing validation/trust semantics; PR #137 history-preserving back-synced that follow-up into `dev`.
- Validation-only PRs #131/#132 and the dev-based automation review PR #133 are superseded and closed without merge.
- The documentation-governance baseline is accepted in `main` and synchronized into `dev`; active runtime branches must preserve it when updated/merged rather than restoring older workflow/process text.
- PR #99 remains separate open historical work and is not an accepted baseline; any useful delta must be reconciled against the current line before reuse.

## Immediate next step

1. Build 406 remains device-rejected; retain its CI evidence only.
2. Implement one bounded Build-407 A/B: because the Painter always externally tints native center Drawables, resolve the verified HyperOS `_tint` sibling for **all** native center resources before `setTint(...)`, not only when `centerFollowsBatteryColor=true`.
3. Remove the Build-406-only conditional presentation flag if it is no longer needed; keep the resource resolver cached and fail-soft when a sibling is absent.
4. Do not change center size/position, optical probe, outer geometry, battery semantic-color authority, Home carrier/spacing or Phase-2B scene behavior.
5. Run source review and signed Canary validation; freeze runtime as soon as the Build-407 Canary exists.
6. Device A/B must explicitly test both `centerFollowsBatteryColor=false` and `true` on light/dark surfaces.
