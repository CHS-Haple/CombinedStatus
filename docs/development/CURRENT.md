# Current Development State

This file is the concise recovery point for active Guiyuan development. Read it after `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Keep chronological Build/investigation history in `DEVLOG.md`, future direction in `ROADMAP.md`, version semantics in `VERSIONING.md`, and record-writing rules in `RECORDING.md`.

## Repository baseline

- Last refreshed: 2026-09-29
- Repository: `CHS-Haple/Guiyuan`
- Stable branch: `main`
- Integration branch: `dev`
- Active display-version line: **0.0.3**
- First planned formal release: **1.0.0**
- Target profile: HyperOS SystemUI `17.03.260226.r`
- Modern Xposed API: 102
- Android namespace/applicationId: `com.chaners.guiyuan`
- Public product identity: **Guiyuan / 归元**
- Pinned MIUIX baseline: `0.9.4-5c91d5e5-SNAPSHOT`

### Stable product baseline

**Build 466 / `20260929-466`** is the current device-accepted and `main`-promoted Guiyuan 0.0.3 product baseline.

- Identity migration PR #168 was integrated into `dev` as `83cfd4d4be139dd3ec9cac870a8450a6dce09d08`.
- Exact-head Full #1690 and signed Work Branch Canary #492 passed before integration; the Build 466 package/module identity was accepted on device.
- Post-merge `dev` Integration #1693 passed target-profile verification, tests/build, Modern Xposed metadata, Haple signing/signature verification, non-debuggable Canary verification, and artifact upload.
- The canonical repository is now `CHS-Haple/Guiyuan`; repository history, branches, PRs and Actions history were retained through the rename.
- Promotion branch and `dev` were identical at `8fca6f0e450da0231efd9be302b1893bab6d391e`.
- Ready-state promotion Build #1707 passed; PR #170 merged to `main` as `be3cc0ae872b328d0a41d49a2599ec53950f3476`.
- Post-merge main Full #1708 passed the stable validation surface, including signing/signature verification and artifact upload.
- Existing `CombinedStatus*` implementation class/object names remain intentional internal identifiers; they are not a second public product identity.

### Accepted lineage inside Build 466

- **SystemUI runtime behavior:** Build 456 / `20260929-456`, integrated by PR #163 as `d70b416ba531651c6690027b7404b1854fdb3056`. Device validation accepts Home, Keyguard, AOD-native gating, QS_FAKE transition ownership, session-scoped native ignored-slot ownership, Hot Reload continuity, and cleanup restoration on the pinned target.
- **App icon:** Build 452, integrated by PR #166 as `44b10371e0709d155468f7f2e67307fde5f11ab2`. The Guiyuan mark uses the accepted rotationally symmetric adaptive-icon geometry.
- **Companion app:** Build 464, integrated through PR #165 as `a2394db92ce208771956defcd558c954065000f7`; Build 465 advanced the integrated display line to 0.0.3. Home Runtime Status, production-rendered Preview Sandbox, Features hierarchy, Diagnostics action styling, and MIUIX-aligned Sandbox controls are part of the accepted baseline.

## Current phase

Phases 2A, 2B, 3 and 4 are complete for the validated baseline:

- **Phase 2A:** Home carrier / presentation architecture.
- **Phase 2B:** unlocked Home continuity + bounded Control Center transition bridge.
- **Phase 3:** Keyguard / lockscreen / AOD scene completion.
- **Phase 4:** companion-app Home / Preview Sandbox integration.

The next executable phase is **Phase 5 — adaptive sizing, spacing and broader visual controls** on the 0.0.3 development line.

## Current architecture / ownership boundary

### Home

`MiuiNotificationStatusContainer / system_icon_area (HostSession) -> MiuiStatusBatteryContainer / system_icons.overlay (visual carrier) -> resolved Home layout -> Guiyuan renderer`

SystemUI owns surrounding native layout, Battery presentation/hide behavior, native tint semantics, Home visibility, and charging/Super-Island motion. Guiyuan owns its compact composition and only narrowly scoped reversible presentation state.

### Control Center / QS_FAKE

Unlocked/Home and enabled Keyguard source scenes may project Guiyuan through the verified top-level `ControlCenterFakeStatusIcons` QS_FAKE transition owner. Compact cutover waits for native layout readiness. Fully expanded Control Center is native-only through HyperOS fake/final appearance ownership.

Notification Shade itself does not present the target status-icon row on the pinned profile and remains native-only.

### Keyguard / AOD

Keyguard uses a separate host/session adapter while sharing domain/render semantics. The user setting controls steady Keyguard Guiyuan eligibility. AOD remains native-only through the verified native AOD authority. Home and Keyguard do not share mutable host/session ownership.

### State, layout and cleanup

- Prefer authoritative HyperOS/SystemUI semantic state and native resources.
- One mutable runtime property has one writer.
- Stable geometry, transition geometry, native slot occupancy, and optical adjustment remain separate concerns.
- Keyguard/QS_FAKE ignored-slot state is session-owned and restored by owned delta; Home keeps its separately validated scoped path.
- Hot Reload preserves continuous generation handoff without forcing native peer reflow between generations.
- Compatibility uncertainty fails native rather than leaving a partial replacement.

## Validation state

There is no open device-blocking defect on the promoted Build 466 baseline.

Accepted evidence includes:
- Build 456 runtime device acceptance and post-merge Integration #1651;
- Build 452 icon device acceptance and post-merge Integration #1596;
- Build 464 companion-app UI acceptance;
- Build 466 identity/package device acceptance;
- Full #1690, Work Branch Canary #492 and `dev` Integration #1693;
- ready promotion Build #1707;
- post-merge `main` Full #1708.

Historical rejected/superseded Builds and hypotheses remain in `DEVLOG.md`; do not restore them from old branches or chats.

## Active branch boundary

No pre-promotion `feat/*` or `fix/*` branch is a valid continuation base for Phase 5.

- `feat/visual-tuning-controls` is fully behind current `dev` and carries no unique current commits.
- Other inspected historical feature/fix branches are substantially diverged and/or still reference the pre-Guiyuan package layout.
- Old open PRs must not be merged merely because they remain open; their requirement must be re-evaluated against current `dev`.

New executable work must branch from the synchronized current `dev` baseline.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Root-cause-first; no geometry/motion/timing compensation without verified ownership.
- Preserve native HyperOS state/resource authority where available.
- Do not add duplicate polling, state machines, transition animators, or per-frame diagnostic work.
- Keep Home, Keyguard, QS_FAKE and final Control Center ownership boundaries explicit.
- Notification Shade and AOD remain native-only unless new exact-target evidence deliberately changes that contract.
- Runtime failure must restore/defer to native presentation.
- Current icon geometry remains frozen unless new device evidence reopens it.
- `CombinedStatus*` internal symbols may remain; public/app/package identity is Guiyuan / 归元 / `com.chaners.guiyuan`.

## Immediate next step

1. Start Phase 5 from the synchronized current `dev` baseline on a new focused `feat/*` branch; do not revive `feat/visual-tuning-controls` or other historical implementation branches.
2. First Phase-5 checkpoint: adaptive Guiyuan visual sizing and neighboring spacing from resolved geometry, while keeping native slot occupancy, visual width, transition geometry, and optical spacing independently owned. Reuse the production renderer in Preview Sandbox.
3. Keep per-state battery-ring color-source controls as a separate bounded checkpoint unless implementation review proves the same owner/boundary. Reuse existing native battery semantic/color authority rather than creating a second mode state machine.
4. Keep 1.0.0 gated by the existing release-qualification matrix and explicit maintainer authorization.

## Reference priority

For new work, use this order:
1. current `CONTRIBUTING.md`;
2. this `CURRENT.md`;
3. `ROADMAP.md` and applicable architecture/reference docs;
4. current source + exact-target SystemUI evidence;
5. historical DEVLOG/device evidence only as context, never as automatic authority.
