# Current Development State

This file is the concise recovery point for active Combined Status development. Read it after `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Keep chronological Build/investigation history in `DEVLOG.md`, future direction in `ROADMAP.md`, version semantics in `VERSIONING.md`, and record-writing rules in `RECORDING.md`.

`main` and `dev` runtime baselines remain unchanged by documentation-only commits. Work-branch checkpoints are development evidence until their required validation and maintainer acceptance are complete.

## Current phase

The project remains in **Phase 2A — 0.0.2 Home carrier / presentation architecture**.

The selected Home direction is an existing-host composition rather than the superseded permanent extra-participant / occupancy-handoff route:

`MiuiNotificationStatusContainer / system_icon_area -> host-scoped overlay -> resolved Home layout -> Combined Status renderer`

SystemUI remains authoritative for surrounding native layout, Battery scene/hide behavior, native tint semantics, and charging/Super-Island motion. Combined Status owns its compact composition plus only narrowly scoped, reversible Home presentation state.

Home -> shade / Control Center projection is **Phase 2B**. Keyguard / lockscreen / AOD follows after Phase 2B.

## Current runtime checkpoints

- Builds 386-393 are historical evidence for the superseded permanent extra-participant route; they are not the current architecture premise.
- **Build 397** is the first device-accepted checkpoint for the tested Phase-2A charging-carrier scenarios.
- **Build 398** strengthens stable width authority by using the live native `battery_icon_container`; it is carried forward but was not separately device-promoted before the next checkpoints.
- **Build 399** separates active/inactive battery-ring arc compositing without reopening Home carrier ownership.
- **Build 403 / `20260927-403`** is the current battery semantic-color runtime candidate. Runtime source: `97ef67e648906a4b9bb2ce4d7dd390e955831189`.
- PR #105 may advance through documentation-only commits without creating a new runtime Build; until APK-affecting source changes, Build 403 remains identified by runtime source `97ef67e648906a4b9bb2ce4d7dd390e955831189`.

Build 403 validation already established:
- Fast Build #1063: **success**;
- signed Work Branch Canary #322: **success**;
- target-profile, unit/build, Modern Xposed metadata, signing, non-debuggable and artifact checks: **passed**.

## Active runtime issues / validation

### Visual intensity / grayscale parity — open

Latest maintainer screenshots on the active color/intensity line still show an apparent grayscale/visual-weight difference between Combined Status elements and neighboring native status icons. This means visual parity is **not accepted yet**.

Current boundary:
- Build 399's non-overlapping battery-arc compositing remains the active correction;
- native status-icon tint remains the intended monochrome authority;
- native drawable alpha normalization remains shared rather than per-resource;
- do **not** add per-glyph gray multipliers, replacement gray constants, screenshot-derived magic numbers, or source-asset edits merely to force a visual match;
- the remaining mismatch must be attributed to the actual final compositing/tint/alpha path before another visual correction is accepted.

### Battery semantic colors — implemented, device acceptance still open

Build 403 uses HyperOS `MiuiBatteryMeterIconView.getProgressStatus()` as semantic-state authority. Charging, power-save, performance, and low-battery colors come from SystemUI's already-loaded native color fields when HyperOS optimization allows them; normal state and unavailable semantic colors fall back to the resolved native status-icon tint.

No user-facing per-state color picker/source selector is exposed yet. The future policy seam remains: **System default / Follow status icon / Custom** for NORMAL / CHARGING / POWER_SAVE / PERFORMANCE / LOW.

### Home -> shade scene boundary — next separate issue

A shallow notification-shade pull / final held-return frame can still leave the Home Combined Status overlay visible. This is **not intended final behavior** and is classified as the next Phase-2B scene-boundary/handoff problem, not as a reason to reopen the accepted steady Home carrier.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Home is the only Combined Status rendering surface currently treated as runtime-verified.
- Unsupported/unverified surfaces remain native until their own host/lifecycle/handoff contract is validated.
- Reuse authoritative HyperOS/SystemUI state and resources when a verified source exists.
- Native peer geometry, Battery translation/alpha/visibility, and island animation remain SystemUI-owned.
- No polling, per-frame follower, timing retry, duplicate layout-occupancy owner, or magic translation/margin compensation should be introduced for scene handoff.
- Fail toward native SystemUI when an ownership, compatibility, or restoration contract cannot be established safely.

## Repository / branch synchronization

- PR #100 remains the architecture work branch based on `dev`.
- PR #105 is intentionally stacked on PR #100.
- The documentation-governance baseline is already accepted into `main` and back-synced into `dev`; active runtime branches must preserve it when they are updated/merged rather than restoring their older README/CURRENT/ROADMAP variants.
- PR #99 remains separate open historical work and is not an accepted baseline; any useful delta must be reconciled against the current line before reuse.

## Immediate next step

1. Treat the latest screenshots as active evidence that grayscale/visual-intensity parity is still unresolved; quantify/attribute the final rendered difference before changing color/alpha policy.
2. Validate Build 403 semantic colors across the applicable native states while preserving the accepted Phase-2A Home carrier/spacing behavior.
3. Update `CURRENT.md` and append `DEVLOG.md` immediately when that device result changes acceptance.
4. After color/intensity closure, move to the already-identified Phase-2B shallow-shade scene-boundary leak without reopening steady Home carrier ownership.
