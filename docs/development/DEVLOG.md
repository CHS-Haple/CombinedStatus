**Type:** focused device-evidence timing refinement  
**Display version:** 0.0.3  
**Build:** 549 / `20261001-549`  
**Branch / PR:** `feat/battery-top-readout` / #181  

### Device evidence

Build-548 video confirms the continuous retract topology remains correct and the Build-545 discontinuity does not return. A small outlet-side residual arc is still visible for several frames after CENTER/network has already committed to the exit, so the remaining defect is only late completion.

### Root cause

Build 548 finishes the ring at 45% of the existing HyperOS transition clock. The symmetric smoothstep keeps the last visible arc continuous, but the completion point is still later than the desired choreography.

### Change

Single-variable AB:
- `TRANSITION_COMPLETE_PROGRESS: 0.45f -> 0.35f`;
- local ring progress reaches 0.5 at global progress 0.175 and 1.0 at 0.35;
- existing symmetric smoothstep remains unchanged;
- LEFT/RIGHT/NONE ordered-arc semantics remain unchanged;
- CENTER/network native target geometry and timing remain unchanged;
- Battery target/handoff, reverse symmetry, and Build-542 island behavior remain unchanged.

### 审查 / review

- timing scalar only; no new geometry gate, Animator, delay, or second timeline;
- Build-546/547/548 continuity preserved; Build-545 live gate remains rejected;
- ownership, lifecycle, single-writer, Fail-native, and performance behavior unchanged;
- steady rendering, battery-top controls, typography handoff, native peer motion, and island projection untouched;
- remap test now locks 0.175 -> 0.5 and 0.35 -> 1.0; existing arc/direction tests remain authoritative.

### Validation

Run exact-head Runtime CI, then one signed exact-head Canary. Primary device check: residual outlet-side arc should clear earlier than Build 548 while remaining visually continuous on normal/fast pulls and symmetric on reverse collapse.
